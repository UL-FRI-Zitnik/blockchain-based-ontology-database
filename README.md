### Run Ethereum node on Infura (hosted node)
In order to connect to other Ethereum node change ethereum/nodeAddress in config.yaml

### Run IPFS node
[IPFS](https://ipfs.io/#install)

### Run program
set heap space big enough to input ontology files e.g. -ea -Xmx2048m

### Run program on the dataset from the article Blockchain-based transaction manager for ontology databases
We have run three configurations sequentially (A, B and C), (A, B and C), ... several times. 
Three run configurations in XML format used for scenarios A,B,C are available in folder `.idea/runConfigurations`
Jetbrains editor will load configurations when opening the project.
For each run of the configuration csv file with measurements of the run gets created which were used for the analysis of results.
